## Overview
The files in this folder are reference files used in the Multiple 
Myeloma seqFISH assay used at TGen in our automated analysis pipelines 
or are used for reference visualization of standard commercial assay in 
IGV

### Files:

##### GRCh38_Commercail_FISH_Probes.bed
Contains mapping locations, sometimes approximate, of commercial FISH 
probes commonly used in the field relative to GRCh38/hg38/b38 coordinates. 
Details on the mapping and estimation of location is availabe in a 
shared presentation (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k0Oq-HNAKxhD3CXyXcN_KyrSLkBUCdbUHTCDpiZMOng/edit?usp=sharing)

##### GRCh38_Myeloma_FISH_Probe_Locations.bed
Contains locations used in the seqFISH assay at TGen in GRCh38/hg38/b38 compatible 
workflows like Phoenix

##### Myeloma_FISH_Probe_Locations.txt
Contains locations used in the seqFISH assay at TGen in GRCh37/hg19/b37 compatible 
pipelines like Medusa or Pegasus
