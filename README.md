# MMRF CoMMpass Study

### What is the MMRF CoMMpass Study?

The MMRF CoMMpass Study is an observational clinical trial (NCT01454297) of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients sponsored by the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (https://www.themmrf.org/).  Each patient is required to receive an initial treatment consisting of a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent or a combination containing both drug classes. Each patient will be observed for at least eight years with clinical data collected every three months in the first 5 years and then every six months for the last three years of observation.  There is also extensive molecular profiling data available on each patient at diagnosis and at each subsequent progression event.

### Public Access to the Data

Data generated from the MMRF CoMMpass Study is released in a staged manner every six months as part of planned interim releases. These six month interim analysis releases generally occur every January 15th and July 15th.

1. Interim Release Date (Month 0)
    1. Data is released to the PCC Sponsors (Amgen, BMS, Janssen, Takeda)
2. Six Months Later (Next Interim Release)
    1. Data is released to the contributing clinical sites
3. Twelve Months Later (Two Interim Releases Later)
    1. Data is released to the general public

## Information About This Repository

The molecular characterization and primary analysis of each patient is performed at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen, an affiliate of City of Hope).  In an attempt to ensure the international community interested in Multiple Myeloma can maximally leverage the dataset we are making essential methods and tools related to the analysis performed at TGen available throught this public repository.
